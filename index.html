      Japan’s’ 2011 Tohoku earthquake presented to the world the importance of 
      coastal structures and the role these protective measures play in reducing 
      vulnerability for businesses and others who may settle along the coastline. 
      This article will reveal the structural failures occurred and the impacts that 
      these failures caused as well as analysing the key factors which led to these
      structural failures such as rapid water flow, poor building design and the 
      impact of moving debris. By using this case study, we can analyse data and
      graphs to see what went wrong and which mitigation strategies can be used 
      in the future.

       <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="ex">
    <pre>
      The 2011 Tohoku earthquake is seen to be one of the most devastating events
      in Japan’s natural disaster history. The 9.0 magnitude earthquake had led to 
      vast levels of destruction with high and powerful waves being generated and 
      travelling across the Pacific Ocean. Buildings, bridges and other infrastructure 
      were heavily damaged or destroyed, which conveyed the issues regarding the 
      design and construction of structures on the Japanese coast due to the lack 
      of protection which was present. The tsunami had also instigated a major nuclear 
      accident at a power station along the coast. The reason for this devastation 
      will be revealed by examining facts and figures from credited sources, highlighting 
      certain building materials used to show why the impacts were so vast as well as 
      providing mitigation strategies for future events.

      <h3 id="Structural Damage And The Impacts">Structural Damage And The Impacts</h3>
    <p class="ex">
    <pre>
      Although aware of the risks from earthquakes, buildings and infrastructure along
      the coast were wooden and only some major buildings were of concrete 
      material, as could be seen from videos available online. This resulted in very little 
      damage to buildings caused by the earthquake, but major damages caused 
      by the tsunami, since wooden, earthquake resistant houses are not well fitted to 
      withstand a tsunami however for the first 3 km inland, most of the buildings were 
      destroyed, regardless of their structure suggesting that the sea wall along the coast 
      provided little to no protection leading to increased fatalities as seen in the figure below.

      Figure 1 - provides an insight into the number of fatalities by community along the coast 
      combined with mean measured and modelled run up. [4]

      <img src="Screenshot 2024-12-05 201752.png" width="1219" height="694">
      
      [4] = Figure 2 – The structural section of the table is our focus here. This area shows which 
      sort of tsunami countermeasures were present during the event.

      Structural measures were in place to try and mitigate the impacts of tsunamis, however because 
      of the massive devastation, these measures failed to prevent disaster to a certain extent. Some 
      positives of these measures are that the sea walls, although damaged and in some cases completely 
      collapsed, reduced the wave height and avoided greater damage. [4] 

      According to (EERI 2011) the coastal forests did not perform well in terms of protection. These 
      dense coastal forests have a damping effect on tsunami waves, especially on their flow velocities. 
      However, this effect decreases significantly with increasing wave heights and as these mitigation 
      forests are not very dense, an uprooting occurred and washed away most of the coastal forests which 
      proved fatal when referring to Figure 1. [5]. 

      As well as structural measures there were some non-structural measures in place such as early warning 
      systems. The system uses seismic sensors and ocean buoys to detect earthquakes and tsunamis, sending 
      warnings to the public within seconds of an event.  [6] Therefore, this gave people time to evacuate 
      or take shelter during the tsunami. 

      [7] Public awareness and education was another huge non-structural measure and still is. In the years 
      leading up to the 2011 tsunami, the government and local authorities regularly conducted disaster 
      preparedness drills, particularly in coastal areas. These drills included evacuation exercises and 
      educating people on what to do during an earthquake or tsunami. Schools and communities were actively 
      engaged in raising awareness, ensuring that the population understood the risks and knew the proper 
      evacuation routes.

      However, both the warning systems and public awareness and education are less significant here as 
      due to the magnitude of the earthquake, the tsunami still managed to cause immeasurable amounts of 
      damage socially, economically and environmentally but acknowledging these measures provides an 
      insight into what measures were relied upon when the structural measures from Figure 2 failed. 
      Following up from this, the costs resulting from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan alone were 
      estimated at $220 billion USD. The damage makes the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami 
      the most expensive natural disaster in history. [8]

      <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="ex">
    <pre>
      In conclusion, the 2011 Tohoku earthquake showed that there was a lack of understanding with 
      the structural measures in place and how these measures would react to extreme tsunami loading. 
      In terms of understanding structural failure, this disaster mainly conveys the importance of being 
      prepared for such events with proper infrastructure, good building quality and proper structural measures 
      to limit fatalities, extremely high costs and extreme damage to the environment. With Japan having incredible 
      engineers and engineering standards, gaps were revealed from this event which need to be addressed in the 
      future in terms of building codes, enhancing early warning systems, and increasing public awareness. 
      By learning from the events of 2011, Japan can continue to strengthen its infrastructure and better 
      protect its coastal communities from the devastating effects of tsunami loading. [10] 
      The failures of structural defences are a reminder that structural measures alone were not sufficient 
      to protect people and buildings from a major disaster such as this. These defences might be able to reduce 
      the impact but should be designed so that they can survive even if the tsunami owes over them. [11]
