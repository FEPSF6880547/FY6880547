      Japan’s’ 2011 Tohoku earthquake presented to the world the importance of coastal structures and the role these protective measures play in reducing vulnerability for businesses and others who may settle along the coastline. This article will reveal the structural failures occurred and the impacts that these failures caused as well as analysing the key factors which led to these structural failures such as rapid water flow, poor building design and the impact of moving debris. By using this case study, we can analyse data and graphs to see what went wrong and which mitigation strategies can be used in the future.

      The 2011 Tohoku earthquake is seen to be one of the most devastating events in Japan’s natural disaster history. The 9.0 magnitude earthquake had led to vast levels of destruction with high and powerful waves being generated and travelling across the Pacific Ocean. [1] Buildings, bridges and other infrastructure were heavily damaged or destroyed, which conveyed the issues regarding the design and construction of structures on the Japanese coast due to the lack of protection which was present. The tsunami had also instigated a major nuclear accident at a power station along the coast. [2] The reason for this devastation will be revealed by examining facts and figures from credited sources, highlighting certain building materials used to show why the impacts were so vast as well as providing mitigation strategies for future events.
